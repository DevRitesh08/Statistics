# Why Only Square Matrices Can Have Inverses

An inverse is possible only for square matrices because it is related to the concept of a matrix being a bijective linear transformation, which implies both injectivity (one-to-one) and surjectivity (onto). A square matrix represents a linear transformation between vector spaces of the same dimension, where the domain and codomain are the same. When a square matrix is invertible, its linear transformation is bijective, meaning that it has a unique inverse transformation.

Let's consider why non-square matrices cannot have inverses:

1. If a matrix A has more rows than columns (m > n), i.e., a tall matrix, the linear transformation it represents is from a lower-dimensional space to a higher-dimensional space. In this case, the transformation is generally not surjective (onto), as there are output vectors in the higher-dimensional space that have no corresponding input vector. Consequently, there is no inverse transformation that can map every output vector back to an input vector.

2. If a matrix A has more columns than rows (m < n), i.e., a wide matrix, the linear transformation it represents is from a higher-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space (dimension reduction). In this case, the transformation is generally not injective (one-to-one), as multiple input vectors can map to the same output vector. Consequently, there is no unique inverse transformation that can map each output vector back to a unique input vector.

Again, the inverse of a matrix is possible only for square matrices because these matrices represent linear transformations between vector spaces of the same dimension. Only in these cases can a matrix potentially satisfy the conditions of being a bijective transformation, i.e., both injective and surjective, which allows the existence of a unique inverse transformation. However, not all square matrices have inverses; only those that are non-singular (with a non-zero determinant) have an inverse.
